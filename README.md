# CVE-2022-32898: ANE_ProgramCreate() multiple kernel memory corruption


Nov 23, 2022 • Mohamed GHANNAM (@_simo36)

## Intro:

While reverse-engineering the process of which the Apple Neural Engine loads a model in the kernel level, I identified two interesting memory corruption vulnerabilities in the code responsible for processing the neural network features in H11ANEIn::ANE_ProgramCreate_gated(). These kind of vulnerabilities, in my opinion, are easy to find when manually auditing the kernel driver, but nearly impossible to catch with fuzzers unless you build something incredibly sophisticated.

## Analysis:

The ZinComputeProgramGetNamesFromMultiPlaneLinear() and ZinComputeProgramGetNamesFromMultiPlaneTiledCompressed() functions are both responsible for parsing the procedure input and output, or more precisely, the LC_THREAD command with thread flavor 2 (ane_bind_state) whose binding_type_info value is 4 and 5.

From what I can tell, binding_type_info = 4 means that a procedure’s input has more than one plane, and binding_type_info = 5 means that the input not only has more than one plane but is also compressed.

The ZinComputeProgramGetNamesFromMultiPlaneLinear() function for example takes 5 arguments: a load command pointer, a thread binding pointer, and three extra output arguments. The last output argument planes is an array that will hold planes, or kernel pointers, whose contents are controlled by the user, and the last argument planeCount will indicate how many planes (or kernel pointers) were copied into planes from the model.hwx file. The following is the function definition:
